				<h1>Victor Model Products is closing</h1>
				<p>
					In 1975, George Dornis set out to bring model RC boating to the world. He accomplished that and much more.
					It is with heavy hearts that after more than four decades of bringing joy into people's lives we must say goodbye as we close our doors.
					We're proud of the community we have built and support we have received over the years and can't thank you all enough.<br /><br />
					
					<div style="width: 500px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
						Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. <br /><br />
